# Master's in Big Data Analitycs: *"Stocks selection: a medium/long-term approach using Machine Learning techniques"*

## SUMMARY



Stock selection is the act of identifying and choosing specific stocks to include in a portfolio based on certain criteria to match investors objectives. In this study, we propose a machine learning (ML) technique for approaching medium to long term investments using big market capitalization companies from the US, that is able to consistently outperform the market. The data acquired for the ML model construction, consists of fundamental data of the companies listed in the mayor US stock markets and macroeconomic data. The expanding window method is employed with a one-year time horizon, spanning from 2000 to 2021. An extremely randomized tree (ET) classification model is applied to 22 different data sets. Each year, the portfolio is selected based on the companies with higher probabilities. Subsequently, the return over that portfolio was calculated for the year after, avoiding data leakage from the future. We have also tuned the most important hyperparameters of that model and prove that there is enough statistical evidence to affirm that our model beats the market consistently, overruling the efficient market hypothesis (EMH). Finally, the variability of the model was studied for the construction of the final model, in which the trade-off between stability and higher returns was taken into consideration.
